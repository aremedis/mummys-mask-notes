given a map that leads to Wajit's Walk
Dark Depository is at bottom of a deep 'abandoned' Well
few scholars have tread the halls
forbidden knowledge has spawned things which have never seen the sun.

Were at one time guardians, but unclear on current status.
4 disticnt sections of the depository:

Well is about 450 ft deep

At the bottom of the well are a pair of double bronze doors.

Ferus believes the doors are trapped.  Shrivken reports there's an abjuration aura upon the doors.

```Three short corridors slope down from the center of this cruciform chamber, each ending at a wall with a large, carved stone faceâ€” one frightened, one sad, and one angry. Tablets, statues, icons, and carvings cram the corridors. A fourth hallway leads west to a set of bronze double doors.```

Skeletal bones with a crocodile skull



Section 1:

```
The walls of this cramped chamber are riddled with shelves, cabinets, and cupboards wreathed in cobwebs. More than a dozen sarcophagi stand against the walls, all with disturbingly blank carved faces.
```
	
Section 2:

```
A vast collection of scrolls, clay tablets, and stone carvings litter this chamber, the records neatly stored on shelves and haphazardly scattered across the floor.
```

Section 3:

Ferus opened the door, and a strange mechanical creature appeared:

```
This creature looks like a mechanical centaur. Golden, clockwork wings sprout from its back, and its arms end in barbed chains
```

We killed the Xelekhut, and it vanished.  Almost as though it had been summoned, instead of waiting for us.


```
A series of high walls blanketed in hieroglyphs forms a twisting maze of narrow corridors in this chamber. Shelves, recesses, cabinets, and cubbyholes crammed with scrolls, stone slates, and wax tablets line the walls.
```

Amongst the 'stacks' are some shadowy bear-dogs
