found a room where the tiles flew at us a la zelda

brass doors that when picked, relocked themselves

found a magic ring in tile room while searching for a way to bypass the doors.

Introduced the doors to Gladys

another set of double bronze doors after the first with the same locking enchantment.  These doors were also introduced to Gladys

past these door is a room full of curtained alcoves along the walls.  center of the room is a large statue of what appears to be Pharasma.

While exploring, attacked by a teleporting undead thingy that teleported the party in seemingly random directions
